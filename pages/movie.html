        <h1>Spiderman: No Way Home</h1>
        <p>
          With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, our friendly neighborhood
          web-slinger is unmasked and no longer able to separate his normal life
          as Peter Parker from the high stakes of being a superhero. When Peter
          asks for help from Doctor Strange, the stakes become even more
          dangerous, forcing him to discover what it truly means to be
          Spider-Man.

        Spider-Man: No Way Home is an upcoming American superhero film based on
        the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures
        and Marvel Studios, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is
        intended to be the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and
        Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel
        Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Jon Watts, written by
        Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker /
        Spider-Man, alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jon Favreau, Jacob
        Batalon, Marisa Tomei, J. B. Smoove, Benedict Wong, Alfred Molina, and
        Jamie Foxx. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch)
        to help make his identity as Spider-Man a secret following its public
        revelation in Far From Home. A third MCU Spider-Man film was intended as
        early as 2017, during production on Homecoming. By August 2019,
        negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal—in
        which they produce the Spider-Man films together—ended with Marvel
        Studios leaving the project; however, a negative fan reaction led to a
        new deal between the two companies a month later. Watts, McKenna,
        Sommers, and Holland were set to return at that time. Filming began in
        October 2020 in New York City, before moving to Atlanta later that
        month. During filming, Foxx and Molina were revealed to be appearing in
        the film, reprising characters from past Spider-Man films. The title was
        revealed in February 2021, before filming wrapped at the end of March.
        Spider-Man: No Way Home is scheduled to be released in the United States
        on December 17, 2021, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. A fourth
        Spider-Man film is in development.
